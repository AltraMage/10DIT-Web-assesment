            <h2>Other activity's</h2>
            <p>During my life I have done several other activity's. </p>
            <p>One of these would be rugby, I played that for 4 years until I was 8. Turns out I don't like contact sports.</p>
            <p>I did Karate for a few years as well, but didn't like all of the seriousness that went with it.</p>
            <p>Finally I settled on scouts, and with age, venturers where we play activity's for the term and eventually, do them. Recently we did a night drop where we made our way from Newlands to a park in Grenada village. </p>

    <h4>Video Games</h4>
    <p>For over a decade now I have been playing video games, It started of with Portal at my uncle's during the school holidays, now  I play games almost daily with my friends. The games I mostly play now are Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six siege and Minecraft. Other than those I have played several other games along the way like;</p>

    <h4>Floorball</h4>
    <p>Floorball is similar to unihock but more civil and when I started playing I loved it.</p>
    <p>For Christmas last year I got my first Floorball stick and have been practicing at home in my spare time!</p>
